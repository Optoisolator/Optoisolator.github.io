Come along, have some fun and I'm sure you'll fit in somewhere, be you fluffy, feathery, fleshy or even scaley!</em></p><p style="font-family: helvetica,arial; font-size: 16px; font-style: regular;"><em>I sincerely hope that each and every one of you has a great time here and wish you all the best in whatever you do!</em><br /><em>- Ranch the Deer, Owner</em></p><h3 style="font-family: helvetica,arial; font-size: 16px; font-style: regular; text-align: center;"><strong><em>Server Rules</em></strong></h2><p style="font-family: helvetica,arial; font-size: 16px; font-style: regular;">Now here's where we get into the nitty-gritty of what you should and shouldn't do.</p><p style="font-family: helvetica,arial; font-size: 16px; font-style: regular;">Though this list may look daunting and foreboding, as long as you respect other players and take care not to disrupt their experiences on the server, then you should be fine!</p><p style="font-family: helvetica,arial; font-size: 16px; font-style: regular;"><em><strong>THESE RULES ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGE AT ANY TIME!</strong></em></p><h3 style="font-family: helvetica,arial; font-size: 16px; font-style: regular; text-align: center;"><br /><strong>--== General Rules ==--</strong></h3><p style="font-family: helvetica,arial; font-size: 16px; font-style: regular;"><br />1a) You *must* be 14 or over to play on the server. We don't mean to discriminate against younger players, but we need this rule in order to moderate the quality and size of our playerbase.</p><p style="font-family: helvetica,arial; font-size: 16px; font-style: regular;">1b) You must have a good comprehension of the English language. If you do not speak English, you cannot play here.</p><p style="font-family: helvetica,arial; font-size: 16px; font-style: regular;">1c) Do not minge. Minging is defined as doing something with the express intention of causing someone distress or annoyance.</p><p style="font-family: helvetica,arial; font-size: 16px; font-style: regular;">1d) If you are annoying people, stop. Even if you aren't breaking the rules, you should always respect other players, and if a fair amount of other players don't want you to do it then don't.</p><p style="font-family: helvetica,arial; font-size: 16px; font-style: regular;">1e) Common sense applies. If you're unsure of whether something breaks the rules or not, ask a member of staff in-game or on the Discord.</p><p style="font-family: helvetica,arial; font-size: 16px; font-style: regular;">1f) Our policy on NSFW content is that it's allowed as long as it's kept out of sight of the general playerbase. For example, if you are creating an NSFW contraption, then build it out of sight of people. If you are working on an NSFW PAC, make sure to mark the NSFW portions as explicit, and if you are playing NSFW on a media player, keep it away from spawn and put a sign warning that the TV is displaying NSFW content.</p><p style="font-family: helvetica,arial; font-size: 16px; font-style: regular;">1g) What defines acceptable and unacceptable content or behaviour may be partially up to the discretion of the staff member on at the time, who will choose a suitable punishment depending on your previous offenses and the severity of the rule breakage. Administrators and moderators both use the rules as guidelines when making their decisions, and should adhere to them where possible. However, the rules are a guideline and not a limitation. If you are doing something which has the clear intent of causing other players annoyance or grief, you will be punished, regardless of whether it is explicitly a rule or not.</p><p style="font-family: helvetica,arial; font-size: 16px; font-style: regular;">1h) Using Wiremod or any other tools to intentionally give yourself an unfair advantage over other players, or to inhibit other players' ability to build or play in any way, shape or form is prohibited. This includes, but is not limited to, blinders, player pushers, prop tornados, wire turrets set above the maximum damage limit (see 3c), etc.</p><h3 style="font-family: helvetica,arial; font-size: 16px; font-style: regular; text-align: center;"><br /><strong>--== Building/Buildmode Rules ==--</strong></h3><p style="font-family: helvetica,arial; font-size: 16px; font-style: regular;"><br />2a) Buildings must not of be a great detriment to server performance. Whilst we encourage our players to create elaborate contraptions using all the resources available to them, server strain should be kept at a minimum due to a lack of resources available to the server. If your contraption or build is causing the server's performance to decrease substantially, even unintentionally, then you must either optimise your build or remove it or sections of it to prevent lag.</p><p style="font-family: helvetica,arial; font-size: 16px; font-style: regular;">2b) Builds must be of an acceptable size. If you are building something that obstructs a large proportion of the map, make sure to get permission from an administrator or someone of higher rank. If a large majority of players complain about your build and want it removed due ot it obstructing too much space, you must remove it.</p><p style="font-family: helvetica,arial; font-size: 16px; font-style: regular;">2c) Buildmode bases must (for the most part) follow the guidelines for PvP bases, but may deviate from the rules slightly depending on the type. If in doubt, ask a member of staff on whether your building is acceptable. Certain restrictions may be lifted for buildmode bases provided that all the occupants and the owner will not use it for PvP.</p><p style="font-family: helvetica,arial; font-size: 16px; font-style: regular;">2d) If you are in buildmode, you may not engage in PvP with people who are in PvP mode. This includes fighting players using vehicles, contraptions and the like. However, if you know for certain that another player is in buildmode, and they have consented to it, you may combat each other.</p><h3 style="font-family: helvetica,arial; font-size: 16px; font-style: regular; text-align: center;"><strong>--== PvP mode rules ==--</strong></h3><p style="font-family: helvetica,arial; font-size: 16px; font-style: regular;"><br />3a) Spawnkilling is not allowed. If the map that has been loaded does not have any form of spawn protection, then that does not give you an excuse to shoot players as they spawn in. Wait until they have left the spawn and are a moderate distance away before engaging in combat.</p><p style="font-family: helvetica,arial; font-size: 16px; font-style: regular;">3b) Exploiting no-pvp zones to gain an unfair advantage over players (this includes areas protected by a safezone where you may not take damage) is disallowed.</p><p style="font-family: helvetica,arial; font-size: 16px; font-style: regular;">3c) Wire turrets may only have a maximum damage of 30 for all turrets on a contraption. For example, if you had one turret, you could set the damage to 30, but if you have two, you may only set each turret to 15 damage, as 15 + 15 = 30.</p></body>
